These models can be used with the sample program samples/c/latentsvmdetect.cpp
or samples/cpp/latentsvm_multidetect.cpp

Latent SVM models are taken from the original work from the authors at
https://github.com/rbgirshick/voc-dpm

For conversion I used the program by amc-nu found at
https://github.com/amc-nu/Latent-SVM-MAT2XML-Converter
