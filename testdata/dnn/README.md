### OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library - DNN Module

This folder contains extra data that supports the DNN module
of OpenCV. It also includes data needed for the accuracy and
performance test suite for this module.

Often the DNN models themselves are not stored in this repository.
These models can be downloaded with `download_models.py` located
in this same folder.

Errors during the test suite `Can't find data file: dnn/...` are
resolved by downloading these models.
